Consult the CIS, NIS, AWS and STIG documents and tell me which security controls are recommended for creating a security baseline for the PRODUCT_NAME product. This baseline will be used by the technical areas to apply the security configurations defined in this document.

Response Format: 'CONTROL: RATIONALE: REFERENCE'. It is essential to explicitly name the control, elucidate its relevance in mitigating risks associated with the use of cloud services, and indicate a specific reference for further information. The rationale should directly connect the control to its effectiveness in reducing specific risks. The reference should point to specific documents, guides, or articles from the recognized entities (AWS, NIST, CIS), providing a solid foundation for a detailed understanding or validation of the control's efficacy.

Prioritize the inclusion of all relevant recommendations from these entities to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary security measures, thereby forming a holistic and complete view of the recommended security strategies.

Avoid adding any introductory or concluding comments; the response should strictly include the detailed controls, their justifications, and references.

For example:

CONTROL: Encryption at Rest and in Transit. RATIONALE: Implementing encryption at rest and in transit is critical for protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches, ensuring that intercepted data remains inaccessible without the appropriate decryption keys. REFERENCE: AWS Security Best Practices Guide, https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/.
CONTROL: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). RATIONALE: The use of MFA significantly increases security by adding an additional layer of verification, considerably reducing the risk of unauthorized access resulting from compromised credentials. REFERENCE: AWS MFA documentation, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html.
