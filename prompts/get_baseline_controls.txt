I am embarking on the development of a comprehensive security baseline specifically designed for PRODUCT_NAME, with the objective of addressing the broad spectrum of security risks associated with cloud service utilization. These risks encompass unauthorized access, data breaches, service interruptions, and vulnerabilities unique to the product among others. In pursuit of creating an all-encompassing and robust security framework, I am soliciting your expertise to delineate every applicable security control that would mitigate these risks, including those that are universally applicable as well as those that may be specific to certain security domains or to the product itself.

Please adhere to the following structured format for your recommendations:

Response format: "CONTROL: RATIONALE: REFERENCE", where you are to succinctly name the control, articulate its importance in mitigating particular risks associated with the use of cloud services, and provide a reference for further information. The rationale should directly link the control to its effectiveness in addressing risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, service disruptions, etc., with each reference offering a basis for deeper understanding or validation of the control's efficacy.

Maintain the focus of your response, emphasizing the direct correlation between each control and its role in risk mitigation, accompanied by a precise reference.

Avoid adding any introductory or concluding comments; the response should strictly include the detailed controls, their justifications, and references.

For instance, your format could resemble the following:

CONTROL: Encryption at Rest and in Transit. RATIONALE: Encrypting data both at rest and in transit provides a critical layer of security against unauthorized access and data breaches by ensuring that intercepted data remains encrypted and unreadable without the necessary decryption keys. REFERENCE: AWS Security Best Practices document, https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/.
CONTROL: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). RATIONALE: MFA significantly enhances security by necessitating multiple forms of verification, thereby greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. REFERENCE: AWS MFA documentation, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html.
