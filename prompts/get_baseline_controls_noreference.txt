I am in the process of crafting a security baseline tailored for PRODUCT_NAME, with a focus on mitigating the inherent risks of cloud storage such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and service interruptions. To ensure the security framework is robust and targeted, I seek your expertise in pinpointing the three paramount controls that should be incorporated. When proposing these controls, please adhere to the following guidelines:

Format your response as follows: "CONTROL: RATIONALE", where you succinctly name the control and directly tie its importance to mitigating a specific risk associated with cloud storage.
Your rationale should explicitly connect how the control addresses one or more of the aforementioned risks (unauthorized access, data compromise, and service disruptions).
Ensure the response is concise, limiting it to the essential information that directly relates the control to its rationale within the context of cloud storage security.
Refrain from including introductory or concluding remarks; only the specified format for the controls and their rationales is required.
Example of the expected format:

CONTROL: Encryption at Rest and in Transit. RATIONALE: Encrypting data both at rest and in transit protects against unauthorized access and data compromise by ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unintelligible without the decryption keys.
CONTROL: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). RATIONALE: MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring two or more verification methods, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials.
CONTROL: Regular Security Audits. RATIONALE: Conducting regular security audits allows for the early detection of vulnerabilities and unauthorized changes, helping prevent data breaches and ensuring the integrity of the cloud service.
