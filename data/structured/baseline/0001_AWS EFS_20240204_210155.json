    "Remediations": {
        "Remediation1": "To apply the principle of least privilege access control in your AWS environment, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze Access Requirements: Identify the specific access requirements for each user, group, or role in your environment. Determine the minimum level of permissions needed to perform their intended tasks.\n\n2. Create Custom Policies: Create custom IAM policies that grant only the necessary permissions required for each user, group, or role. Avoid using overly permissive policies or policies that include unnecessary actions or resources.\n\n3. Use IAM Roles: Assign IAM roles to AWS resources like EC2 instances, Lambda functions, etc., instead of using long-term access keys. IAM roles allow you to grant temporary and scoped permissions to resources, based on their specific needs.\n\n4. Implement Permission Boundaries: Use permission boundaries to set the maximum permissions that can be assigned to a user or role. This ensures that even if an administrator grants additional permissions, they are limited by the permission boundary.\n\n5. Regularly Review and Audit: Continuously review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and update permissions based on evolving business requirements and changes in access needs.\n\n6. Enable MFA: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged actions, such as IAM user sign-ins or access to sensitive APIs.
