1. **Enforce IAM authentication** - This is the core way AWS identifies the resources in your AWS accounts. By enforcing IAM authentication, you can secure access to your EFS filesystems and define specific access rights. For instance, you can set specific conditions such as source IP, in order to limit access from designated sources only.

2. **Encrypt data at rest** - By enabling data encryption at rest, you can protect stored data from unauthorized access. With AWS Key Management Service (KMS), you can also control your own encryption keys.

3. **TLS encryption in transit** - This ensures that data cannot be intercepted and read during transmission. This is particularly important when using third-part or public networks. AWS encourages use of AWS EFS mount helper, which natively supports encryption during transit.

4. **Network access control with security group rules** - By using Amazon VPC security group rules, you can control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. For example, you can limit inbound NFS traffic to your Amazon EFS file systems to only your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premise servers.

5. **NFS export permissions** - You can configure NFS export permissions for each EFS file systems which contributes to the high level of security. For example, you can set read-only permissions for an entire EFS file system.

6. **Enable AWS CloudTrail logs** - CloudTrail allows governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It enables continuous monitoring which is key to detecting unusual and unauthorized activities.

7. **Enable file system backups** - It is important to back up your data to protect against accidental loss or corruption. You can schedule AWS Backups for regular automatic back up schedules.

8. **VPC endpoints connection** - Connecting to your EFS filesystems via VPC endpoints ensures your data is not traversing over the internet thereby increasing security.

All these configurations enforce the principle of least privilege, which ensures that an entity has no more access than absolutely needed. Use of the multi-layer security approach can ensure a tighter security posture overall.
