Here are some key security settings to consider for Amazon S3, along with their corresponding rationales:

1. **Bucket Policies** - Setting specific policies for each S3 bucket can allow or deny permissions based on specific conditions such as IP addresses, IAM (Identity and Access Management) user, time, etc. This gives businesses granular control over their buckets.

2. **Versioning** - Enabling versioning on S3 buckets is a good practice because it allows for easy recovery of objects in case of accidental deletion or overwrite.

3. **Server Side Encryption (SSE)** - Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. It automatically encrypts data on save and decrypts on read which adds an additional layer of security.

4. **SSL for Data In Transit** - To protect data in transit, enforce SSL-only communication. Data sent over the network will be encrypted, making it more secure against interception.

5. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** - With ACLs, you can selectively grant permissions to specific users or user groups.

6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete** - It adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional authentication to delete stored data.

7. **Public Access Block** - Ensure that there are blocks in place to prevent public bucket policies, which can inadvertently expose sensitive data.

8. **AWS PrivateLink** - Configuring AWS PrivateLink for S3 can help to ensure that traffic between your Amazon VPC and S3 does not leave the Amazon network, providing additional privacy and security for data transfers.

9. **Object Lock** - Object Lock can prevent the deletion of an object for a set period of time, providing added protection against accidental deletions.

10. **CloudTrail Loggings** - Enable AWS CloudTrail to log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. It provides event history for security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.

Remember, the combination of these controls will help to ensure that your data stored in Amazon S3 is secure, but there might be additional considerations based on your specific organizational needs and requirements.
