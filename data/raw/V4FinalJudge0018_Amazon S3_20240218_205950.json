These controls and practices are derived from general guidelines applicable to AWS services, highlighting S3 where applicable.\n\n1. **Enable S3 Block Public Access (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Protect your S3 data from unauthorized public access by enabling Block Public Access settings at both the bucket and account levels. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html\n\n2. **Enforce Encryption in Transit (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Use SSL/TLS to protect data in transit to and from Amazon S3. Ensure your clients are configured to use HTTPS. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html\n\n3. **Implement Server-Side Encryption for Data at Rest (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Enable default encryption on S3 buckets to ensure data is automatically encrypted upon upload. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html\n\n4. **Use S3 Versioning to Protect Data from Accidental Deletion (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Enable versioning on S3 buckets to keep multiple versions of an object, protecting against accidental deletion. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html\n\n5. **Enforce MFA Delete Capability (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the deletion of S3 objects to enhance data protection. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html\n\n6. **Enable Logging for S3 Buckets (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Utilize S3 server access logging and AWS CloudTrail for auditing and monitoring access to S3 resources. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html\n\n7. **Regularly Review S3 Bucket Permissions (CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark)**: Periodically review access policies and ACLs for S3 buckets to ensure that only authorized access is allowed, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Source: https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf\n\n8. **Limit S3 Buckets and Objects Access to Trusted AWS Accounts (NIST Cybersecurity Framework)**: Use S3 bucket policies to explicitly allow access only from trusted AWS accounts, aligning with the \"Access Control Management\" guideline. Source: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf\n\n9. **Implement Automated Replication for Data Resiliency (AWS Security Best Practices)**: Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) or Same-Region Replication (SRR) to automatically replicate data across buckets for enhanced resiliency and disaster recovery. Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html\n\n10. **Evaluate S3 Bucket Configuration Against STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides)**: Regularly assess S3 bucket security configurations using automated tools and manual review to ensure compliance with security technical implementation guides. While STIGs do not specifically target S3, the general principles apply. Source: https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/\n\nEach control and guideline is crafted with the specific aim of enhancing the security posture of Amazon S3 resources, aligned with established security practices and frameworks."
