Here are the additional or specific recommendations found in the \"internal-rules-s3.md\" document that were not explicitly mentioned in the previous summary:\n\n1. **Naming Convention:**\n   - **Prefix Requirement**: All S3 bucket names must begin with the prefix \"XPTO-\" to signify company management.\n   - **Environment Indication**: The bucket name must include an abbreviation indicating the environment (e.g., \"dev\", \"test\", \"prod\").\n   - **Descriptive Name**: Bucket names should include a clear, descriptive name that reflects its contents or intended use, using hyphens to separate words.\n   - **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**: Bucket names must not contain any PII or sensitive data descriptors.\n\n2. **Security Policies:**\n   - **Encryption**: All S3 buckets must have server-side encryption enabled using Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys.\n   - **Public Access**: Buckets must not be publicly accessible unless approved by the security team. The default policy must deny public access.\n   - **Access Logging**: Enable access logging for all S3 buckets.\n   - **Versioning**: Enable versioning on all S3 buckets to protect against accidental deletions and overwrites.\n   - **Cross-Region Replication**: Consider enabling for critical data to ensure availability in regional failures.\n\n3. **Compliance and Monitoring:**\n   - **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of S3 bucket policies and configurations.\n   - **Automated Alerts**: Set up alerts for non-compliant configurations or suspicious access patterns.\n   - **Documentation**: Maintain documentation for each S3 bucket, including purpose, configuration, and exceptions.\n\n4. **Enforcement**: Notes repercussions for failure to adhere to these policies, highlighting the importance of individual and team responsibility for compliance.\n\nFilename for reference: **internal-rules-s3.md (Company Internal S3 Bucket Policy Document)**."

Best practice is to avoid using publicly readable or writable buckets. Consider using [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) to detect buckets that are publicly available, and Amazon CloudFront to serve content from Amazon S3. Verify that buckets that should not allow public access are properly configured to prevent public access. By default, all S3 buckets are private, and can only be accessed by users that have been explicitly granted access.\n5. **Use [AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html)**: IAM Access Analyzer analyzes Amazon S3 buckets and generates a finding when [an S3 policy grants access to an external entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-resources.html#access-analyzer-s3).\n6. **Use [Amazon S3 versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) and [object lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html) when appropriate**.\n7. **Use [Amazon S3 Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html)**: Amazon S3 Inventory can be used to audit and report on the replication and encryption status of your S3 objects.\n8. **Review [Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.html) and [AMI sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharing-amis.html) permissions**: Sharing permissions can allow images and volumes to be shared with AWS accounts that are external to your workload.\n9. **Review [AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) Shares periodically to determine whether resources should continue to be shared**: Resource Access Manager allows you to share resources, such as AWS Network Firewall policies, Amazon Route 53 resolver rules, and subnets, within your Amazon VPCs. Audit shared resources regularly and stop sharing resources which no longer need to be shared."
