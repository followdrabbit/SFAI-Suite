This change is designed to ensure that the buckets and the data contained within them are not inadvertently exposed to public access. \n\n2. **Automatic Disablement of S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Alongside the Block Public Access feature, Amazon S3 will also disable S3 access control lists (ACLs) for all new S3 buckets. This move aims to encourage the use of more modern and flexible access management practices, such as using bucket policies and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies, which provide more granular control over access permissions.\n\nThese changes reflect ongoing efforts by AWS to enhance the security posture of Amazon S3 by safeguarding user data against accidental public exposure and simplifying permission management to prevent unauthorized access. \n\nFor existing S3 users or specific use cases requiring different configurations, it may be necessary to adjust these settings manually after the creation of a new bucket, depending on the specific needs and security requirements of the applications using Amazon S3.\n\nSource: [Amazon S3 Applies Two New Default Bucket Security Settings](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-s3-security-best-practices-buckets-default/)"

It's particularly useful for disaster recovery and ensuring data availability.\n\n2. **S3 Object Lock:** Leveraging S3 Object Lock to create immutable copies of data is recommended for protecting against accidental or malicious deletions and edits. This feature enables a write-once-read-many model, ensuring the integrity and immutability of the data.\n\n3. **Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (KMS):** It is recommended to implement encryption of objects created in your bucket by default, using keys managed through AWS KMS. By doing so, only authorized users with access to the correct encryption keys can restore the encrypted data.\n\n4. **Cross-Account Access Management:** By adding the source AWS account number in the destination account AWS KMS console, access is granted to encrypt and decrypt object replicas. This management of access ensures that data is protected and only accessible by authorized accounts.\n\nThese security recommendations are part of a larger strategy to build a robust data protection architecture on Amazon S3, ensuring data is encrypted, immutable, and redundantly stored across isolated environments to protect against threats and ensure business continuity.\n\nSource: [Modern Data Protection Architecture on Amazon S3 - Part 1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/modern-data-protection-architecture-on-amazon-s3-part-1/)"
