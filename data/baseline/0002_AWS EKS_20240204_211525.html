        <ul>
            <li>Control ID: Control2</li>
            <li>Rationale: Container Network Policies allow organizations to define and enforce network traffic rules between pods within an Amazon EKS cluster. By implementing network policies, organizations can control and restrict network communication between pods, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the cluster.</li>
            <li>Audit: To check if Container Network Policies have been implemented in your Amazon EKS cluster, you can use the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`. Here are the steps:

1. Install and configure `kubectl` on your local machine and authenticate it to your Amazon EKS cluster.

2. Run the following command to list the network policies in your cluster:

```
kubectl get networkpolicies --all-namespaces
```

3. This command will display the network policies defined in all namespaces. Look for the network policies specific to your namespace or pods within your namespace. If there are network policies listed, it indicates that container network policies have been implemented in your cluster.

By following these steps, you can determine whether Container Network Policies have been implemented in your Amazon EKS cluster.</li>
            <li>Remediation: To apply Container Network Policies in your Amazon EKS cluster, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the Network Policy: 
   a. Create a YAML file specifying the desired network policy rules. You can use the Kubernetes Network Policy API to define the network policy rules according to your requirements.
   b. Example YAML for a simple network policy that allows traffic only from certain pods:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: my-network-policy
     namespace: <your-namespace>
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app: <your-pod-label>
     ingress:
     - from:
       - podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             app: <allowed-pod-label>
   ```

2. Apply the Network Policy:
   a. Use the `kubectl` command-line tool to apply the network policy YAML file to your cluster. Replace `<your-namespace>`, `<your-pod-label>`, and `<allowed-pod-label>` with the appropriate values from your specific deployment.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f <path-to-your-yaml-file>
   ```

   b. The network policy will be applied to the specified namespace and pods, controlling and restricting network communication between those pods according to the defined rules.

By following these steps and customizing the YAML file according to your requirements, you can implement Container Network Policies in your Amazon EKS cluster.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Implement Kubernetes Pod Security Policies.</h2>

   a. Create a YAML file that defines the Pod Security Policy rules. You can refer to the Kubernetes Pod Security Policies documentation for examples and guidance on creating the YAML file.
   b. Example YAML for a simple Pod Security Policy that restricts privileged containers:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
   kind: PodSecurityPolicy
   metadata:
     name: my-pod-security-policy
   spec:
     privileged: false
     allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
     ...
   ```

2. Apply the Pod Security Policy:
   a. Use the `kubectl` command-line tool to apply the Pod Security Policy YAML file to your cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <path-to-your-yaml-file>
   ```

   b. The Pod Security Policy will be applied to your cluster, and the defined rules will be enforced for new pods created in namespaces associated with the Pod Security Policy.

3. Associate the Pod Security Policy with Namespace(s):
   a. To enforce the Pod Security Policy rules in a specific namespace, you need to associate the Pod Security Policy with that namespace.
   b. Use the `kubectl` command to set the `podsecuritypolicy` field in the namespace metadata.

   ```bash
   kubectl edit namespace <your-namespace>
   ```

   c. Add or update the `podsecuritypolicy` field with the name of the Pod Security Policy you created.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Namespace
   metadata:
     name: <your-namespace>
     annotations:
       ...
     labels:
       ...
     spec:
       podSecurityPolicy: "<your-pod-security-policy>"
   ```

   d. Save the changes and exit the editor.

By following these steps and customizing the YAML file according to your requirements, you can implement Kubernetes Pod Security Policies in your Amazon EKS cluster.</li>

            <li>Control ID: Control4</li>
            <li>Rationale: AWS IRSA allows organizations to associate IAM roles directly with Kubernetes service accounts, enabling fine-grained access control and eliminating the need for managing and distributing AWS IAM user credentials within a cluster. By enabling IRSA, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and improve security posture by following the principle of least privilege.</li>
            <li>Audit: To check if AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) have been enabled and associated with Kubernetes service accounts in your Amazon EKS cluster, you can use the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`. Here are the steps:

1. Install and configure `kubectl` on your local machine and authenticate it to your Amazon EKS cluster.

2. Run the following command to list the service accounts in your cluster along with their associated IAM roles:

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccounts --all-namespaces -o custom-columns='NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,ANNOTATIONS:.metadata.annotations.' | grep eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn
```

3. This command will display the service accounts that have the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation, indicating that they are associated with IAM roles. If there are service accounts listed with the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation, it indicates that IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) have been applied in your cluster.

By following these steps, you can determine whether AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) have been enabled and associated with Kubernetes service accounts in your Amazon EKS cluster.</li>
            <li>Remediation: To apply AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) in your Amazon EKS cluster, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an IAM role:
   a. Go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the IAM service, and create a new IAM role that defines the permissions and policies required for the service account.
   b. Make sure to add the necessary permissions for the specific AWS services and resources that the service account will access.

2. Create a Kubernetes service account:
   a. Use the `kubectl` command-line tool to create a Kubernetes service account that will be associated with the IAM role.
   
   ```bash
   kubectl create serviceaccount <service-account-name> --namespace <namespace>
   ```

3. Associate the IAM role with the Kubernetes service account:
   a. Annotate the Kubernetes service account with the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the IAM role.
   
   ```bash
   kubectl annotate serviceaccount --namespace <namespace> <service-account-name> eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=<iam-role-arn>
   ```

   Note: Replace `<service-account-name>`, `<namespace>`, and `<iam-role-arn>` with the appropriate values specific to your setup.

By following these steps, you can enable AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) and associate IAM roles directly with Kubernetes service accounts in your Amazon EKS cluster.</li>

        <h2>Enable AWS CloudTrail Logging.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Control ID: Control11</li>
            <li>Rationale: AWS CloudTrail provides detailed logs of events and API calls within an AWS account. By enabling CloudTrail logging, organizations can monitor and audit activity in their AWS EKS environment, helping to detect and investigate any unauthorized access attempts or potentially malicious actions.</li>
            <li>Audit: To check if AWS CloudTrail logging has been enabled for your AWS account and Amazon EKS environment, you can use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. Here are the steps for both methods:

Using AWS Management Console:
1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.
2. Check the list of trails displayed to determine if there is a trail configured for logging EKS-related events. You should see at least one trail associated with your account or EKS environment.
3. Access the specific trail and review its settings to verify if it includes EKS API operations and events.

Using AWS CLI:
1. Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.
2. Run the following command to describe the configured trails in your AWS account:

```bash
aws cloudtrail describe-trails
```

3. Review the output to check if there is a trail configured for logging EKS-related events. Each trail will have different attributes, including the ARN, name, and configuration details.

By following these steps, you can determine whether AWS CloudTrail logging has been applied in your AWS account and if there are trails specifically set up to capture EKS-related events.</li>
            <li>Remediation: To apply "CONTROL: Enable AWS CloudTrail Logging" in your AWS account and Amazon EKS environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Using AWS Management Console:
   a. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudTrail service.
   b. Click on "Create trail" or "Get Started" to set up a new trail.
   c. Configure the trail settings, such as providing a trail name, specifying the storage location for logs (such as an S3 bucket), and selecting the AWS services and event types you want to log.
   d. Enable the "Include Global Services" option to capture activities associated with global services like IAM.
   e. Select the EKS-specific events, such as Cluster and Nodegroup APIs, for more detailed logging of EKS-related activities.
   f. Review other configuration options, including log file encryption and log file validation settings, according to your organization's requirements.
   g. Create the trail to complete the enablement process.

2. Using AWS CLI:
   a. Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.
   b. Run the following command to create a new CloudTrail trail with the desired settings:

   ```bash
   aws cloudtrail create-trail --name <trail-name> --s3-bucket-name <s3-bucket-name> --include-global-service-events --enable-log-file-validation --is-multi-region-trail
   ```

   Replace `<trail-name>` with a name for your trail and `<s3-bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket where the logs should be stored.
   
   c. Run the following command to update the trail to include EKS-specific events:

   ```bash
   aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail-name> --event-selectors 'ReadWriteType=All,IncludeManagementEvents=true,DataResources=[{Type=AWS::EKS::Cluster},{Type=AWS::EKS::Nodegroup}]'
   ```
